### ⚠️ Notice

There are some fake “AirPosture” apps that are not mine — they are malicious impersonations attempting to distribute malware built by "Vibe-scammers".

Huge thanks to [Maxdme124](https://www.reddit.com/user/Maxdme124/) for flagging this so quickly. Please stay safe and only download AirPosture from the official links provided here.
