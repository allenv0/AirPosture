### 🚨 Notice

There are some fake “AirPosture” apps that are not mine (removed by Github) — they are malicious impersonations attempting to distribute malware built by "Vibe-scammers". Huge thanks to [Maxdme124](https://www.reddit.com/user/Maxdme124/) for flagging this so quickly. Please stay safe and only download AirPosture from the official links provided here.

The code in this repo isn’t up to date because these people were misusing it to spam. As promised, I’ll share the full source code once the 1.0 version officially launches on the App Store.
